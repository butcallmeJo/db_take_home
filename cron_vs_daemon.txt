"Describe some of the pros and cons to using cron and using a daemon."

There are multiple differences between using cron and using a daemon.

Using cron has a couple benefits:
    - It does not use ressources when the program isn't running.
    - If the program crashes, it will restart at the next scheduled time.
There are a couple of cons tho:
    - It isn't available/running all the time
        - This makes it harder to be constantly listening to outside input.
    - Bad tool to use if program needs to run more than once a minute.

Using a daemon has a few benefits as well:
    - running all the time
        - permanently available
    - it can remember the state of previous runs
        - can make program more efficient
Cons of using a daemon:
    - Restarting it is more complex if it quit unexpectedly
    - Using system ressources all the time
        - Can lead to memory leaks if not being careful

There are some overlaps where both could be used, but you might want to choose one over the other. For the take home assignment we were told to use a daemon which would be the right choice since we want to be able to access the log in real time as well as providing an output every 10 seconds.
